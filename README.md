can not decide what they are interested in or someone who needs a career change, Career path is designed to give detailed steps
and recommendations for what kind of job, school, certifications, or plan you need to succeed pursuing the career that best matches them.

code to the Career Path website. 

Here is a link to the project to see the full extent of the project: https://github.com/CareerPathForEveryone/CareerPath

**WireFrames**

Below is a picture of a drawn wireframe created by my classmate based on the ideas we had when we were
in the deciding phase after ideating. It shows the user having a login page and creating an account page
for the first couple of pages. The main representation is the task after creating an account.
After creating an account, the user has to answer a serious of questions on their interest.
Once they have completed the questionaire, they will be given a list of careers that matched their interest.
When they chose the what careers best ineterest them, at this point, they are able to see whta colleges, certifictaions, or 
trade schools would most benefit them in that career.
